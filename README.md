# Methodology and Implementation

This section delves into the methodology and implementation aspects of our project, primarily focusing on the preparation of the initial state of an entangled system shared between parties A and B. Subsequently, we analyze the evolution of this system under the influence of different quantum channels. 

## Initial State Preparation

We begin by discussing the preparation of the initial state, represented by density matrices, for the entangled system shared between parties A and B. This includes the representation of the states \(|\phi^+\rangle\) and \(|\psi^-\rangle\) at \(t=0\) and their corresponding density matrices.

## Evolution under Quantum Channels

We examine the effects of Generalized Amplitude Damping (GAD) and Amplitude Damping (AD) channels on the entangled state. By iteratively applying Kraus operators associated with these channels, we derive the resultant density matrix at a given time \(t\). 

## Analysis of Quantum Channel Effects

Comparative analysis is conducted to assess the influence of GAD and AD channels on entanglement, fidelity, and coherence measures. We explore how these channels impact the dynamics of the entangled state over time, providing insights into their respective effects.
